# 🧠 DisasterBench: Benchmarking LLM Planning in Disaster-Response Multi-Agent Systems

**DisasterBench** is a benchmark for evaluating whether LLMs can generate **executable structured workflows** in disaster-management scenarios.

Unlike conventional tool-use benchmarks, DisasterBench focuses on **workflow grounding under typed interface constraints**:
models must compose semantically similar but operationally distinct agents into valid multi-step plans with correct:

- agent selection
- parameter grounding
- dependency propagation

DisasterBench provides:

- **233 expert-verified planning tasks**
- **26 task-interface agents**
- **81 typed compatibility edges**
- **5 planning paradigms** (DP, CoT, ToT, RAP, ReAct)
- Fine-grained workflow diagnostics through **First-Point-of-Failure (FPoF)** analysis

---

## 🌍 Motivation

Disaster-response systems increasingly rely on heterogeneous AI capabilities such as:

- remote sensing
- change detection
- hydrological forecasting
- image restoration
- mobility prediction
- multimodal event understanding

As LLMs emerge as orchestrators of such systems, a key challenge arises:

> Can LLMs reliably compose specialized agents into executable workflows under interface compatibility constraints?

While existing benchmarks primarily evaluate tool selection or API invocation, real-world disaster workflows require preserving execution consistency across multiple dependent steps.

DisasterBench addresses this challenge through typed workflow planning tasks with executable ground-truth structured plans.

## 📚 Key Features

- **Typed Workflow Planning**  
  Agents are constrained by input/output interface compatibility rather than free-form composition.

- **Executable Structured Plans**  
  Ground-truth workflows include agents, parameters, and dependency structures.

- **Multi-Paradigm Planning Evaluation**  
  Supports Direct Planning, CoT, ToT, RAP (MCTS), and ReAct.

- **Fine-Grained Failure Diagnosis**  
  FPoF localizes the earliest structural failure in generated workflows.

- **Disaster-Response Agent Ecosystem**  
  Covers realistic disaster-management pipelines across sensing, forecasting, restoration, and analysis.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_repo/DisasterBench.git
cd DisasterBench

pip install -r requirements.txt
export PYTHONPATH=.
```

Set API key:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
# or
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
```

---

### 2️⃣ Run Chain-of-Thought Planning

```bash
python3 baselines/test_baseline.py \
  --test_type cot \
  --api openrouter \
  --model_ckpt deepseek/deepseek-v3.2 \
  --data_root data \
  --train_test_json_data benchmark.jsonl \
  --task_num 0 \
  --max_threads 12 \
  --max_tokens 8192 \
  --num_chain_of_thought 16 \
  --use_fewshot True
```

- `--task_num 0` runs the full benchmark
- `--task_num N` runs a single task

Outputs are saved to:

```text
results/<model>/<method>/
```
