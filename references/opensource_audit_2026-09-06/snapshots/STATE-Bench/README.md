STATE-Bench evaluates AI agents on realistic, multi-step enterprise workflows across three domains: **travel**, **customer support**, and **shopping assistant**.

Each task gives the agent a task-local sandbox database, domain-specific tools, and a simulated user. To pass a task, the agent must do multi-step reasoning by gathering the right information with domain tools, applying the correct policy, taking actions to update the database to the right final state when needed, and following the required procedure in conversation.

## Overview

STATE-Bench includes 450 challenging enterprise tasks across three domains.

| Domain | Tasks | Description |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| **Travel** | 150 | Flight, hotel, and car rental bookings; cancellations, updates, fee and policy reasoning, cross-product trip planning |
| **Customer Support** | 150 | Returns, refunds, exchanges, warranty claims, cancellations, shipping issues, and order changes |
| **Shopping Assistant** | 150 | Product search, cart updates, applying promos, loyalty redemption, shipping options, and compatibility checks |

## Choose Your Benchmark Track

Start with the track that matches what you want to evaluate. Each track guide links to the setup and reference docs only when you need them.

| Goal | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| Evaluate an agent or model directly on the provided enterprise benchmark tasks | **[Main Track](docs/RUN_BENCHMARK.md)** |
| Evaluate agentic memory, skills, or prompt optimization | **[Agent Learning Track](docs/AGENT_LEARNING_TRACK.md)** |

The **Main Track** is the default benchmark path. The **Agent Learning Track** uses the same simulator, domain tools, judges, and metrics, but adds train trajectories and a retrieval hook for reusable learnings such as memories, skills, or prompt optimizations.

For run commands and flag selection, start with the relevant track guide. The shared [`run_batch` reference](docs/eval/run-batch.md) lists which flags are required for the built-in agent, custom clients, and learning-track runs.

## Metrics

STATE-Bench reports four headline metrics:

| Metric | What it measures |
| --- | --- |
| **Task Completion pass@1** | Average task completion rate across five runs per task. |
| **Task Completion pass^5** | Percentage of tasks completed successfully on all five runs. |
| **UX Score** | LLM-judged conversation quality on a 1-5 scale. |
| **Cost Per Task** | Average agent cost from user-reported dollars per task. |
